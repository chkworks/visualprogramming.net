Dear audiophiles,

## Getting started

As of this writing, VST support in vvvv is still in preview, so you'll have to follow these requirements:

{{< box >}}
- Download [latest vvvv gamma preview](https://vvvv.org/#Download)
- [Install](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) the NuGet: `nuget install vl.audio.vst -pre`
- Open the [Help Browser](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/findinghelp.html), type "vst" and then open and read the "Getting started" help patch carefully
{{< /box >}}

## What's in the box

Any VST3 plugin you have installed on your machine, in the [default location](https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/115000177084-VST-plug-in-locations-on-Windows) will simply show up in the Node Browser under: Audio -> VST -> Effect or Instrument

*e.g. Driving the [VCV Rack 2](https://vcvrack.com/Rack) (Virtual Eurorack Studio) plugin via MIDI*

Every VST you place as a node has audio in/out but also MIDI in/out pins, so no questions there. Rightclick a node and click `Show UI` to show the plugins editor. 

In order to control some of a plugins parameters from the patch, you can expose them as pins. For this, select a plugin in the Inspektor (Ctrl+I), turn on `Learn mode` and then click the parameters in the plugins editor that you want to have as input pins.

*e.g. Exposing "Oscillator 1 Phase" as input pin* 

This will give you a pin on the node that you can then control from the patch, like so:
