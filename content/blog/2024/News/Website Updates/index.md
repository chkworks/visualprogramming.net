Those of you...

... who are old enough, will remember when vvvv was still served from `vvvv.org`. When we introduced vvvv gamma, instead of adding that entirely new product to the same website, we launched it from `visualprogramming.net`. Now running two sites in parallel in order to keep everyone confused. 

For technical reasons, login to our [Store](https://store.vvvv.org/) and [Forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) though, were still handled via the old `vvvv.org` website. But now, just moments later, we have a new dedicated login provider and it looks like this:

From **December 13, noon CET**, we're starting the following 2-phased transition:

## Phase 1
- Signups on `vvvv.org` will be deactivated (login still possible)
- Store and Forum will be read-only for a while
- When signing up or logging in to the [Store](http://store.vvvv.org) or [Forum](http://discourse.vvvv.org), you'll be directed to our new login provider

> In order to log in via the new login provider for the first time with your existing vvvv.org credentials, **you'll have to go through the "Renew Password" routine once!** This is because the new login provider only knows your username/email but not your password. 

## Phase 2
- The old `vvvv.org` page will move to legacy.vvvv.org 
- What's now on `visualprogramming.net` will move to `vvvv.org`
- `discourse.vvvv.org` will move to `forum.vvvv.org`

If all goes well, we should be back up to normal on Monday the 15th latest. 

Wish us luck and see you on the other side!
